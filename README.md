# Full Stack / Web3 Coding Challenge

## Overview

To run the app on the local git clone the current repo and run 

# yarn 

then run 

it has a env.example file make it as .env file

to run the project run the following command.


# yarn start 

You may visualize alternative data from the subgraph, the above data points are suggestive.
