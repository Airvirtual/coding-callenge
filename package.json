  "description": "A DApp is just like any other Web application however the key difference is the backend runs entirely or mostly on a decentralized network. For the coding challenge you will be creating a data visualizing frontend interfacing with the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) protocol by using their V3 subgraph. A subgraph is a decentralized API that enables developers to query blockchain data quickly. You will only need to define your queries in order to fetch the data required for the frontend.",
